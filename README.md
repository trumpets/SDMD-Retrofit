This sampe project is created for the purposes of the Mobile Computing unit at City College, the International Faculty of the University of Sheffield. It is a multi-screen app with various network calls. It demonstrates starting a new Activity by also passing some extra information to it, retrieving results from an activity, communicating with a REST API located at a remote web server and displaying collections of data using AdapterViews.
